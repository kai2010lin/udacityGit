dir /a //show all files include hidden
git init // to initiate a git repository
git status//to see tracked and untracked files


staging area is a middle stage

git add files// add file to staging area
git status // to see status
git rm files // to remove things from staging area


working directory   =====   staging area  =====   repository


git diff // to see dif between staging and working directory

git diff --staged // compare staging area with repository

git reset --hard // IMPORTANT careful, lose entire changes that is not in the repository

git branch// to see current branch

git branch name// to see branches

git checkout name // to switch branches

git log --graph // see log in graph

//git commit knows who is its father

git checkout loses a few commit unless you have written down commit ID

git checkout -b new_branch_name // create a branch and check out that branch



how to merge changes of 2 different branches
1 switch to master(git checkout master)
2 git merge brach_name1 branch_name2

git show commit ID //to see changes without knowing parent

after mege, you can delete the branch, since it is reachable from master or ...

git branch -d branch_name

encounter merge conflict, solve the conflict, then move on

usually we dont modify commit message for merge


git log -n 1 //show only 1 message
